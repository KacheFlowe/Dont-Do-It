# Don't Do It
Learning a new language can get you down. There's so much to remember! Fear not for Chris Lattner is here to warn you when you make a mistake.

This is an Xcode plugin that displays Chris Lattner warning you to not do what you're doing when you run a build. For now Chris will appear if you forcefully unwrap your Swift optionals.

Remember; me and Shia think you can do it. So get on with it.

* `git clone https://github.com/orta/You-Can-Do-It.git`
* Open the Xcode project.
* Perform the build command.
* Restart Xcode.

### Copyrights

I stole some code from the [AxeMode plugin](https://github.com/alloy/AxeMode) released under the [MIT license](https://github.com/alloy/AxeMode/blob/master/LICENSE)
