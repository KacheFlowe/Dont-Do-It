# Don't Do It
Learning a new language can get you down. There's so much to remember! Fear not for Chris Lattner is here to warn you when you make a mistake.

This is an Xcode plugin that displays Chris Lattner warning you to not do what you're doing when you run a build. For now Chris will appear if you forcefully unwrap your Swift optionals. 

Remember, me and Chris think you can do it. And most importantly we think you can do it without endangering your optionals. So get on with it.
